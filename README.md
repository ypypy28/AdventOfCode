# What is this repository for?
This is just a place where I put my solutions of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) tasks.

## What is Advent of Code?

> Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015.
> — <cite>Advent of Code</cite> on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
>
> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware. — <cite>About</cite> on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/about)

## Why am I doing this?
Just for fun and practice.
